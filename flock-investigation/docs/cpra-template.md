## Legal Basis

- **California Public Records Act (CPRA):** Gov. Code Section 7920 et seq.
- **Response Deadline:** Gov. Code Section 7922.535 (10 days to determine
  whether to comply; 14-day extension for unusual circumstances).
- **SB 34 ALPR Audit Log Maintenance:** Civil Code Section 1798.90.5 et seq.
  (specifically Section 1798.90.52) requires each ALPR operator to maintain a
  usage and access log. While SB 34 mandates log maintenance, the CPRA provides
  the legal mechanism to obtain these records.
- **License Plate Redaction Authority:** Gov. Code Section 7923.600 (law
  enforcement may redact investigatory record details, but the audit metadata
  itself is not exempt).

## Request Letter Template

> **Subject:** California Public Records Act Request -- Flock Safety ALPR Audit Logs
>
> Dear Irvine Police Department Public Safety Records,

> records from the Irvine Police Department's Flock Safety ALPR system for the
> period **[START DATE]** through **[END DATE]**:
>
> ### 1. Organization Audit (Insights tab)
>
> The exportable log found under **Insights > Organization Audit** in the Flock
> web portal (per Flock's ALPR User Guide; also accessible via
> analytics.flocksafety.com). This report documents every search, alert review,
> and plate lookup performed by IPD users. The export includes the following

> - License Plate (queried plate)
> - Case # (case number entered, if any)
> - Filters (any filters applied)
> - Reason (stated justification)
> - Offense Type
> - Search Date/Time
>
> ### 2. Network Audit (Insights tab)
>
> The exportable log found under **Insights > Network Audit** in the Flock web
> portal (per Flock's ALPR User Guide; also accessible via
> analytics.flocksafety.com). This report documents every cross-agency or
> network-level query. The export includes the following fields:
>
> - Name (user who performed the action)
> - Org Name
> - Total Networks Searched
> - Total Devices Searched
> - Time Frame (date range of the search)
> - License Plate
> - Case #
> - Filters
> - Reason
> - Offense Type
> - Search Date/Time
>
> ### 3. Hot List Action Log
>
> The exportable log of all create, update, and delete actions performed on
> IPD's hot lists (alert lists) within the Flock system. Based on Flock's
> standard export format (see Riverside County SO example below), this log
> includes the following fields:
>
> - Timestamp
> - User (who performed the action)
> - Event Type (create, update, delete)
> - Entity Type (e.g., Custom Hotlist Entry, customHotlist)
> - Entity Details (hotlist name, license plate, state, reason, case number,
>   expiry date)
>
> An example of this export from Riverside County Sheriff's Office (CPRA
> C001586, 3,753 entries) is publicly available at:
> https://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2025/08/23/CPRA_C001586_Hotlist.xlsx
>
> ### 4. External Hot List Configuration
>
> Records showing which external hot lists (e.g., NCIC, state stolen vehicle
> files, or lists shared by other agencies) are enabled in IPD's Flock
> configuration, including the source, list name, and activation date.
>
> ### 5. Network Share Settings
>
> Records showing IPD's current and historical network-sharing configuration --
> i.e., which other Flock-equipped agencies IPD shares camera data with or
> receives data from, including the agency name, direction of share
> (inbound/outbound/bidirectional), and effective dates.
>
> ### 6. National Lookup / Statewide Search Settings
>
> Records showing whether IPD has enabled or previously enabled the **National
> Lookup** or **Statewide Search** features in Flock, including activation and
> deactivation dates. (Note: Flock paused the National Lookup pilot program in
> October 2025, but historical activation records remain in the system.)
>
> ### 7. Vigilant / Motorola Solutions ALPR Status
>
> Records showing the current status of IPD's use of **Vigilant Solutions
> (now Motorola Solutions)** ALPR systems, specifically:
>
> - Whether IPD currently maintains an active Vigilant/LEARN account or
>   any Vigilant ALPR hardware or software.
> - Whether IPD's ALPR data is currently shared through Vigilant's
>   **National Vehicle Location Service (NVLS)**.
> - The date IPD transitioned from Vigilant to Flock Safety (if applicable),
>   and whether the Vigilant account was formally deactivated or remains active.
> - Any agreements, correspondence, or configuration records related to
>   the transition from Vigilant to Flock.
>
> (Note: IPD's March 2020 Vigilant LEARN Agency Data Sharing Report, obtained
> via MuckRock FOIA #86954, confirms IPD was actively sharing detection data
> with DHS-HSI, CBP-NTC, and San Diego Sector Border Patrol through the
> Vigilant system as of that date. We are seeking to determine whether this
> sharing continues.)
>
> ---
>
> **Format:** I request all responsive records in **machine-readable format**
> (CSV or XLSX), as the Flock web portal natively supports these export formats.
> PDF printouts of tabular data are not an adequate substitute.
>
> **Redaction offer:** Should IPD determine that specific license plate numbers
> in the audit logs qualify for exemption under Gov. Code Section 7923.600
> (investigatory records), I request that the Department redact only the plate
> values and produce the remaining audit fields (user name, date/time, reason,
> case number, offense type, filters, network counts) rather than withholding
> the records in their entirety. Civil Code Section 1798.90.52 requires ALPR
> operators to maintain usage and access logs, and the CPRA independently
> requires their production. The non-plate metadata does not reveal
> investigatory substance.
>
> **Precedent:** Other law enforcement agencies using Flock Safety have
> successfully produced these exact exports in response to public records
> requests, including **Aurora Police Department (IL)** (MuckRock #203951,
> 18 XLSX files) and **Spokane County (WA)** (2M+ records via RANGE Media).
>
> I ask that you respond within the time period required by Gov. Code Section
> 7922.535. If you determine that any portion of this request is unclear, please
> contact me for clarification rather than treating the request as deficient.
>
> Thank you for your time.
>
> Sincerely,
> **[YOUR NAME]**
> **[YOUR EMAIL]**
> **[YOUR PHONE (optional)]**

## Timeline Expectations

| Milestone | Timeframe |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Initial determination** | 10 calendar days from receipt (Gov. Code Section 7922.535(a)) |
| **Extension (if claimed)** | Up to 14 additional days for "unusual circumstances" (Gov. Code Section 7922.535(b)) |
| **Realistic production** | ~29 days based on prior CPRA requests to IPD (e.g., Joey Scott's Feb-Mar 2025 request) |
| **If no response by day 10** | Send a follow-up citing the statutory deadline |

---

## If Denied or Partially Denied

1. **Demand a written justification.** Gov. Code Section 7922.540 requires the
   agency to identify the specific exemption and explain how it applies.

2. **Challenge overbroad redaction.** If IPD withholds the entire audit log
   rather than redacting only exempt fields, respond that:
   - Civil Code Section 1798.90.52 (SB 34) requires ALPR operators to maintain
     usage and access logs, and the CPRA requires their production upon request.
   - The audit metadata (user name, timestamp, reason, case number) is not
     itself an investigatory record; only the queried plate might be.
   - Gov. Code Section 7922.525 requires agencies to redact exempt portions and
     release the remainder.

3. **Cite precedent.** Aurora PD (IL) and Spokane County (WA) produced these
   exact Flock exports without claiming exemption over the audit fields.

4. **Escalate.**
   - File a complaint with the City of Irvine's City Clerk.
   - File a petition for disclosure in Orange County Superior Court under Gov.
     Code Section 7923.000.
   - If filed through MuckRock, use their appeal workflow to generate public
     pressure and a paper trail.

## Why This Is Hard to Dodge

This request is deliberately structured to neutralize the most common agency
objections:

- **"We don't have that record."** -- The request uses Flock's own feature
  names (Organization Audit, Network Audit, Hot List Action Log) and describes
  the exact menu path (Insights tab). Any Flock administrator can locate and
  export these in minutes. Claiming ignorance is not credible when the request
  includes the navigation instructions.

- **"It's an investigatory record."** -- The request pre-offers license plate
  redaction, removing the only field that could arguably qualify under Gov. Code
  Section 7923.600. The remaining fields (who searched, when, why, what case
  number) are administrative audit metadata, not investigatory substance. SB 34
  (Civil Code Section 1798.90.52) requires agencies to maintain these logs,
  and the CPRA requires their production.

- **"Producing it would be burdensome."** -- The request asks for native CSV/XLSX
  exports that the Flock portal generates with a single button click. There is
  no compilation, review, or manual assembly required. The agency cannot claim
  undue burden for a task that takes less time than reading this paragraph.

- **"No other agency has done this."** -- Aurora PD (IL) and Spokane County
  (WA) have, and we link to a publicly available example export on MuckRock to
  prove it. This eliminates the "novel request" stall tactic.

- **"The National Lookup feature doesn't exist / we never used it."** -- The
  request acknowledges the October 2025 pause of the pilot, signaling that the
  requester already knows the feature's history. Denying its existence when the
  request demonstrates specific knowledge invites a credibility problem in any
  subsequent legal proceeding.

By combining SB 34's log maintenance mandate with CPRA's general disclosure
framework, offering redaction of the only arguably exempt field, and
naming the exact Flock export paths, this request leaves the agency with very
little room to deny or delay without creating a record that looks obstructive
on appeal.
