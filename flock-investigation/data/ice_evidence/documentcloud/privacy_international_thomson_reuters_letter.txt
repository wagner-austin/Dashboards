Smith President and Chief Executive Officer Thomson Reuters Corporation 3 Times Square New York, NY 10036 USA   Cc by email: david.crundwell@thomsonreuters.com; david.girardin@thomsonreuters.com  21 June 2018   Dear James C. Smith  We are writing to express concerns and seek urgent clarifications regarding your companies’ contractual relationships with United States immigration authorities.   As you will be aware, the US government's “zero tolerance” immigration policy has recently received widespread and international condemnation. In the past 2 months, over 2000 children have been forcibly separated from their parents. The American Academy of Pediatrics has said1 that such “sweeping cruelty” causes “irreparable harm” which can “carry lifelong consequences for children”; the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has called the policy “unconscionable.”2  In addition to the policy's clear moral failure, it is also in violation of the US's international commitments. The US is a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which protects families from unnecessary interference by the government. Separating families at the US border is cruel, arbitrary, disproportionate, and a clear contravention of the Article 17 rights of thousands of children and parents.   President Trump’s Executive Order signed on 20 June 2018 will not end the “zero tolerance” approach; indeed, it remains unclear if families will continue to be separated or whether those already separated will be reunited, and it still foresees that families will be detained in detention centres indefinitely, including in military facilities.3  We are concerned that a number of the products and services sold by Thomson Reuters Corporation are being used by US immigration enforcement authorities.   Federal procurement documents show that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has contracts4:                                                   1 https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/Pages/StatementOpposingSeparationofChildrenandParents.aspx 2 https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/06/1012382 3 https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/us/politics/family-separation-executive-order.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=b-lede-package-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news 4 https://annual-report.thomsonreuters.com/downloads/annual-report-2017-thomson-reuters.pdf

• With Thomson Reuters Special Services for a contract worth over $6.7 million in February 2018 to provide its Detention Compliance and Removal office with “subscription data services” (attached). Other documentation shows5 that the contract is for a “continuous monitoring and alert system to track 500,000 identities per month” which is “able to securely process and return aliens’ information and addresses using the following types of specified data: FBI numbers; State Identification Numbers; real time jail booking data; credit history; insurance claims; phone number account information; wireless phone accounts; wire transfer data; driver’s license information; vehicle registration information; property information; pay day loan information;  public court records; incarceration data; employment address data; Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) data; and employer records.” • With West Publishing Corporation, a Thomson Reuters subsidiary, providing it with access to the Consolidated Lead Evaluation and Reporting (CLEAR) system as part of a contract value worth over $20 million (attached). The CLEAR system allows ICE access6 to a “vast collection of public and proprietary records” including phone records, consumer and credit bureau data, healthcare provider content, utilities data, DMV records, World-Check listing, business data, data from social networks and chatrooms, and “live access to more than 7 billion license plate detections”7.  • With West Publishing Corporation providing its Detention Compliance and Removal office with “access to license plate reader database” as part of a contract value worth over $6 million in December 2017 (attached).  We are concerned about the provision of these services and products to an agency enforcing cruel, arbitrary, and disproportionate measures in violation of the US’ international commitments.   We are writing therefore to ask:   • Whether any of the company’s or company subsidiaries’ products or services are being or have been used by US authorities to identity families for immigration enforcement purposes, including parents potentially separated from their children  • What human rights impact assessments of the company’s or company subsidiaries’ products or services have been completed, if any • Whether Thomson Reuters Corporation will commit to not providing products or services to US immigration agencies which may be used to enforce such cruel, arbitrary, and disproportionate measures • Whether Thomson Reuters Corporation will commit to not providing products or services to agencies worldwide which may be used to enforce cruel, arbitrary, and disproportionate measures  Thomson Reuters Corporation through its public commitment to corporate responsibility and inclusion, and foundation have shown a commitment to do business in ways that respect, protect, and benefit its customers, employees, communities, suppliers and environment. We therefore look forward to your quick response.  Yours sincerely    Edin Omanovic  Privacy International                                                  5 https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=71911de5fa638ed0a391f01f520c0e2a&tab=core&_cview=1 6 https://www.thomsonreuters.com/content/dam/openweb/documents/pdf/legal/fact-sheet/clear-brochure.pdf 7 https://legalsolutions.thomsonreuters.com/law-products/solutions/clear-investigation-software/law-enforcement
