ICE (License Plate Readers)\nImmigrants' Rights,\nPrivacy and Technology\nStatus:\nClosed Case\nLatest Update:\nMay 16, 2018\nSummary\nDocuments\nSummary\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit on May 23, 2018 demanding records of ICE\u2019s relationship with private companies to access vast troves of information about drivers through Automated License Plate Reader (ALPR) databases.\n\nEarlier in 2018, it was revealed that ICE purchased access to two private databases of ALPR data for potential use for civil immigration enforcement. This type of data\u2014a scan of each license plate of a vehicle that passes an automated license plate camera, along with the date, time, and exact location the license plate was recorded\u2013can disclose extremely sensitive information about an individual's movements. Aggregation of this information into databases containing billions of license plate scans stretching back months and even years threatens core civil rights and liberties protected by the Constitution.\n\nWhile police departments collect the data for local criminal investigations, ICE may now be using the data for civil immigration enforcement.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks ICE\u2019s contracts with the private companies operating ALPR databases, as well as relevant training material, privacy policies, and other documents showing how ICE uses this surveillance technology.\n\nThe ACLU of Northern California first sought this information through FOIA requests submitted to ICE on March 19, 2018 and March 21, 2018. ICE has improperly withheld the requested records.\n\nThe suit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.\n\nBetween July and December of 2018, ICE produced more than 1,800 pages of documents.\n\nRead More:\n\nRecords Reveal ICE Agents Run Thousands of License Plate Queries a Month in Massive Location Database (June 5, 2019)\n\nDocuments Reveal ICE Using Driver Location Data From Local Police for Deportations (March 13, 2019)\n\nDocuments\n05/16/2018\nFiling: Complaint\n03/13/2019\nUpdate: ALPR Documents from ICE\nLearn More About the Issues in This Case\nImmigrants' Rights\nPrivacy and Technology\nView All Issues\nSTAY INFORMED\n\nSign up to be the first to hear about how to take action.\n\nBy completing this form, I agree to receive occasional emails per the terms of the ACLU\u2019s privacy statement.\n\nAll fields are required unless labeled optional.\nEmail *\nRequired\nZIP code *\nRequired\nSign Up\nNeed Legal Help?\nFinancial Reports\nAnnual Report\nContact Us\nSearch\n\n\u00a9 2026 ACLU of Northern California\n\nUser Agreement\nPrivacy Statement\nFraud Alert"

In addition to operating its news agency, Reuters, the company sells subscription-based information, software, and managed services to the legal, tax, accounting, educational, and law enforcement sectors.\n\nThomson Reuters supports the data-gathering apparatus of the Departments of Homeland Security (DHS) by selling it database subscriptions. Between 2003 and 2021, these contracts amounted to at least $161 million with the company\u2019s subsidiaries Thomson Reuters Special Services and West Publishing Corporation. Other than these direct contracts, Thomson Reuters products are also provided to government agencies through third-party vendors like Thundercat Technology and Motorola Solutions subsidiary Vigilant Solutions.\n\nSince at least 2010, Thomson Reuters subsidiary West Publishing Corporation has been providing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) with access to its Consolidated Lead Evaluation and Reporting (CLEAR) investigative software database, its flagship product for law enforcement. ICE has used CLEAR as part of its Law Enforcement Investigative Database Subscription (LEIDS), \u201ca robust analytical research tool for its in-depth exploration of persons of interest and vehicles.\u201d As part of this subscription, CLEAR provides the agency with public and proprietary information, including license plate data, real-time incarceration data, cell phone and address records, real estate ownership, credit data, professional licenses, criminal and court records, healthcare provider content, consumer and credit bureau data, and data from social media platforms.\n\nICE\u2019s contracts with data brokers like Thomson Reuters have raised concerns among activists and members of Congress, who have stated that everyday activities now give immigration authorities access to people\u2019s addresses, vehicle locations, and other personal information. Congressional members have pointed out that the company\u2019s sale of personal data to ICE is not only an abuse of privacy, but also an abuse of power.\n\nSimilarly, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) awarded Thomson Reuters a contract for an unlimited access subscription to CLEAR in 2021. This contract expired in August 2024.\n\nIn addition to contracting directly with ICE, Thomson Reuters provides personal and proprietary information to state and local police that have information-sharing agreements with ICE. For example, in 2017, Thomson Reuters CLEAR entered into an agreement with Forensic Logic to integrate their \u201cinformation and analysis capabilities\u201d in order to provide information access to police agencies across the U.S. Forensic Logic is the manufacturer of COPLINK and LEAP, two data systems used by local, regional, and state police agencies that facilitate data sharing with ICE.\n\nThomson Reuters has also been a corporate partner of the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications Systems (Nlets), a network of state and local law enforcement agencies that share information. ICE reported that it \u201cdoes not have the ability to query other State and Local Law Enforcement databases for criminal records, DMV records, state court records, and numerous other state databases.\u201d\n\nIn the past, Thomson Reuters has provided ICE with a subscription to a \u201ccontinuous monitoring and alert service that provides real-time jail booking data to support the identification and location\u201d of immigrants upon their release from jail. ICE \u2019s Detention Compliance and Removals office awarded Thomson Reuters Special Services a $6.7 million contract for this service in 2018, renewing an earlier 2016 $1.5 million contract. Since 2021, competitor LexisNexis has provided real-time jail booking data from Appriss Insights to ICE.\n\nPRISON AND IMMIGRATION JAIL LAW LIBRARIES\nECONOMIC ACTIVISM HIGHLIGHTS\nFURTHER INFORMATION\nUnless specified otherwise, the information in this page is valid as of\n2 October 2024\n\u00a0\n\u00a9 2025 AFSC.

ICE uses LPR data from this service in support of administrative and criminal law enforcement missions. In March 2015, ICE published a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) announcing the intention to procure access to a commercial LPR database. In December 2017, ICE updated this PIA indicating that ICE had entered into a contract with a vendor to provide ICE Offices of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) access to an LPR database operated by a commercial partner.\n\nBoth the 2015 and 2017 PIAs describe privacy and civil liberties compliance through ICE-implemented controls. ICE is updating this PIA to document enhanced LPR functionality that will be available to select authorized ICE personnel, including: (i) geographic query \u2013 conducting a query with-in a specified geographic area (HSI personnel only); (ii) plate partial query; and (iii) and the mobile application with phone scan feature (collectively referred to as \u201cenhanced LPR functionality\u201d throughout this PIA). This update further explains ICE\u2019s operational use of these capabilities and associated privacy risks.
