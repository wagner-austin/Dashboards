City of Irvine Immigration Response
Thursday, June 12, 2025

June 12, 2025: 6:25 p.m.: At this time, there are no new updates regarding federal immigration enforcement activity in Irvine. The City continues to monitor the situation closely and will provide additional information as it becomes available.

June 12, 2025: 1:50 p.m.: Earlier this morning, the City of Irvine was notified by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that they would be conducting targeted immigration enforcement operations at several locations throughout the City. It has been confirmed that these activities are focused on locating specific individuals under investigation for criminal activity who also have immigration law-related violations. 

ICE’s current operations in Irvine are not broad immigration raids, and do not appear directed at detaining individuals solely based on their immigration status. 

The City of Irvine’s mission is to create and maintain a community where people can live, work, and learn in an environment that is safe and welcoming for all. The City’s response regarding immigration-related matters has not changed – the City of Irvine continues to focus on providing exceptional services to all in the community regardless of immigration status.  

The Irvine Police Department is not involved in any federal immigration enforcement and remains committed to its role in protecting public safety and serving all members of the Irvine community. 

Given the regional concern and heightened attention surrounding immigration enforcement activities, the City has taken the following steps to ensure transparency, safety, and accurate public information: 

Public Safety Readiness: The City has activated its internal response protocols to ensure adequate law enforcement staffing and public safety support. 
Emergency Operations Center: A Level 1 activation of the Emergency Operations Center has been initiated to provide enhanced monitoring and coordination. 
Public Information: A dedicated webpage will provide timely updates and accurate information regarding the evolving situation. 
Legal Resource Access: The City is implementing a resource program to connect Irvine residents with due-process legal support if needed. Visit cityofirvine.org/immigrationresources.  
Coordination with Community Partners: The City is in contact with local partners, including educational institutions. At this time, there are no reports of ICE enforcement activity occurring at any school or university within Irvine. 

The City of Irvine is committed to maintaining transparency, supporting residents with accurate information, and ensuring public safety for all. Updates will be provided as more details become available.
