HOME • IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT UPDATES
Immigration Enforcement Updates

December 9, 2025: The City of Irvine is not aware of any additional enforcement activity since late July. 

November 11, 2025: The City of Irvine is not aware of any additional enforcement activity since late July. 

October 21, 2025: The City of Irvine is not aware of any additional enforcement activity since late July.

September 8, 2025: The U.S Supreme Court reversed a temporary restraining order issued by a federal district judge in Los Angeles on July 11, 2025. The order prohibited immigration raids in Southern California based on race, location, language spoken, or occupation. This reversed the judgment from two lower courts in the case of Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo, which will allow the federal government to resume enforcement actions at places such as bus stops, car washes, and home improvement stores. On September 24, the federal district court will consider whether to issue a preliminary injunction based on additional evidence. Read more about the Supreme Court ruling(link is external). 

August 23, 2025: Immigration Customs and Enforcement conducted a targeted enforcement operation at a residence in the area of Quail Ridge and E. Knollcrest. One person was taken into custody. This operation appears to be connected with a criminal investigation.

August 19, 2025: The City of Irvine is not aware of any additional enforcement activity since late July.

August 1, 2025: The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the restraining order, denying the federal government’s request for a pause. 

July 21, 2025: The City of Irvine learned that the U.S. Border Patrol conducted targeted enforcement in the City. It was later confirmed that two people were taken into custody in the area of the Irvine Spectrum Center.

July 19, 2025: The City of Irvine learned that the U.S. Border Patrol conducted targeted enforcement in the City. It was later confirmed after the City reached out to U.S. Border Patrol that one person was taken into custody in the area of Main and Executive Circle.

July 11, 2025: A temporary restraining order was issued in a federal lawsuit (Vasquez Perdomo v. Noem) in Los Angeles to stop indiscriminate immigration raids in Southern California based on race, location, language spoken, or occupation. The second temporary restraining order requires access to legal representation.

June 29, 2025: The City of Irvine learned that the U.S. Border Patrol conducted targeted enforcement at two locations in the City. It was later confirmed that five people were taken into custody from a car wash.

June 12, 2025: The City of Irvine was notified by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that they would be conducting targeted immigration enforcement operations at several locations throughout the City.
