To Whom It May Concern:

Pursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:

Hello,

I am requesting records and data related to Senate Bill 674. The law requires certifying agencies that receive certification requests must annually report to the Legislature the number of victims that requested certifications from the particular agency, the number of certifications signed, and the number of certifications denied. The certifications are for U and T Visas.

I am requesting
- The annual reports sent to the legislature as legally required since 2018.
- Department U visa certification policy and protocols since 2024
- Bulletins, emails, memos, directives, or any communications from DHS and/or United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) regarding SB674 and Form I-914s. Search January 2025 to today's date.
- Any memos, bulletins, directives, or formal communications regarding U and T Visas. Search from 2020 to today's date.

Thank you!

The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.

In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.

Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.

Sincerely,

Joey Scott
