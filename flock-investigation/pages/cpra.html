            <pre id="cpra-template">Subject: California Public Records Act Request -- Flock Safety ALPR Audit Logs

Dear Ms. Loza,

Pursuant to the California Public Records Act (Gov. Code Section 7920 et seq.) and SB 34 (Civil Code Section 1798.90.5 et seq.), I request copies of the following records from the Irvine Police Department's Flock Safety ALPR system for the period [START DATE] through [END DATE]:

1. ORGANIZATION AUDIT (Insights tab)

The exportable log found under Insights > Organization Audit in the Flock web portal (per Flock's ALPR User Guide; also accessible via analytics.flocksafety.com). This report documents every search, alert review, and plate lookup performed by IPD users. Fields: Name, Org Name, License Plate, Case #, Filters, Reason, Offense Type, Search Date/Time.

2. NETWORK AUDIT (Insights tab)

The exportable log found under Insights > Network Audit in the Flock web portal (per Flock's ALPR User Guide; also accessible via analytics.flocksafety.com). This report documents every cross-agency or network-level query. Fields: Name, Org Name, Total Networks Searched, Total Devices Searched, Time Frame, License Plate, Case #, Filters, Reason, Offense Type, Search Date/Time.

3. HOT LIST ACTION LOG

The exportable log of all create, update, and delete actions performed on IPD's hot lists (alert lists) within the Flock system. Based on Flock's standard export format (see Riverside County SO example: https://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2025/08/23/CPRA_C001586_Hotlist.xlsx), fields include: Timestamp, User, Event Type, Entity Type, Entity Details (hotlist name, license plate, state, reason, case number, expiry date).

4. EXTERNAL HOT LIST CONFIGURATION

Records showing which external hot lists (e.g., NCIC, state stolen vehicle files, or lists shared by other agencies) are enabled in IPD's Flock configuration, including the source, list name, and activation date.

5. NETWORK SHARE SETTINGS

Records showing IPD's current and historical network-sharing configuration -- which other Flock-equipped agencies IPD shares camera data with or receives data from, including the agency name, direction of share (inbound/outbound/bidirectional), and effective dates.

6. NATIONAL LOOKUP / STATEWIDE SEARCH SETTINGS

Records showing whether IPD has enabled or previously enabled the National Lookup or Statewide Search features in Flock, including activation and deactivation dates. (Note: Flock paused the National Lookup pilot program in October 2025, but historical activation records remain in the system.)

7. VIGILANT / MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS ALPR STATUS

Records showing the current status of IPD's use of Vigilant Solutions (now Motorola Solutions) ALPR systems:
- Whether IPD currently maintains an active Vigilant/LEARN account
- Whether IPD's ALPR data is currently shared through Vigilant's National Vehicle Location Service (NVLS)
- The date IPD transitioned from Vigilant to Flock Safety, and whether the Vigilant account was formally deactivated
- Any agreements or configuration records related to the transition

(Note: IPD's March 2020 Vigilant LEARN Agency Data Sharing Report, obtained via MuckRock FOIA #86954, confirms IPD was actively sharing detection data with DHS-HSI, CBP-NTC, and San Diego Sector Border Patrol through the Vigilant system as of that date.)

---

FORMAT: I request all responsive records in machine-readable format (CSV or XLSX), as the Flock web portal natively supports these export formats. PDF printouts of tabular data are not an adequate substitute.

REDACTION OFFER: Should IPD determine that specific license plate numbers qualify for exemption under Gov. Code Section 7923.600, I request that the Department redact only the plate values and produce the remaining audit fields (user name, date/time, reason, case number, offense type, filters, network counts). Civil Code Section 1798.90.52 requires ALPR operators to maintain usage and access logs, and the CPRA independently requires their production.

PRECEDENT: Aurora Police Department (IL) (MuckRock #203951, 18 XLSX files) and Spokane County (WA) (2M+ records via RANGE Media) have produced these exact exports.

I ask that you respond within the time period required by Gov. Code Section 7922.535. If any portion of this request is unclear, please contact me for clarification rather than treating the request as deficient.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
[YOUR NAME]
