        "bio": "Mayor Cecilia Hupp was elected to the Brea City Council in November 2014, and re-elected in 2018 and 2022. She previously served as Mayor in 2017, during Brea\u2019s Centennial Year, and in 2022. During her service on the City Council, Mayor Hupp has championed housing and community development and advocates for affordable housing opportunities for senior citizens. Mayor Hupp has surveyed the progress of innovative, mixed-use developments at La Floresta, Brea Place, and Central Park Village. She has presided over the conversion of repurposed railroad tracks into a 50-acre linear, multi-use trail, known as the Tracks at Brea, as well as the construction of the 57 Freeway/Lambert Road Interchange. Mayor Hupp has also overseen the implementation of two regional homeless Navigation Centers, in partnership with North Orange County Cities, and approved Brea\u2019s first workforce-housing project. In doing so, Mayor Hupp seeks team-building to achieve mutually-beneficial goals. Mayor Hupp considers herself a fiscal conservative, who believes in prudent spending, as well as transparency in government. While in office, she has lobbied both the state and federal levels over issues such as paramedic tax reform, local control, and pension reform. Mayor Hupp exudes fiscal resourcefulness through having established a $10 million PARS irrevocable trust fund account to assist with the City\u2019s employee retirement obligations. Additionally, she judiciously approved a 25% fiscal reserve policy for the City of Brea\u2019s annual budget.",

Erica organized Laguna Hills' first business meeting connecting the City and the businesses and added City announcements to the agenda. Erica demonstrated ingenuity by adding video messaging to the City, including quarterly reports from the Sheriff's Services, and designating a prescription drop-off site at the Civic Center. As a strong community supporter, Erica co-created with the Laguna Hills Chamber of Commerce their annual Holiday Light Extravaganza; she also structured a partnership with the Chamber of Commerce that included office space at the Civic Center. She filled the Community Center with activities during the winter holiday months and brought Movies in the Park to city residents. In addition, Erica felt it essential to revitalize the LH on the hillside and championed the idea to the Council.",

        "bio": "Tanya Doby has distinguished herself as a leader in Los Alamitos, earning recognition as a 2023 Woman of Distinction by both the State Senate and Assembly and Woman of the Year for her assembly district in 2024. Her journey began with an appointment to the Los Alamitos City Council in 2019, followed by a resounding election to her first full term in 2020, supported by her extensive community involvement and volunteerism. With a robust background in human resources and personnel development spanning over 20 years, Tanya has brought invaluable skills to her role. She is known for her engaging leadership style and commitment to policies that are equitable, efficient, and fiscally responsible. Under her stewardship, Los Alamitos has rebuilt its law enforcement team and strengthened its overall management structure, achieving a fully staffed and funded public safety operation for the first time in nearly a decade. Tanya Doby's dedication to partnerships extends to her role as a founding member of an interagency working group with the Los Alamitos School District. This collaborative effort focuses on enhancing educational opportunities and ensuring safe environments for local children. Notable joint ventures include initiatives to improve school safety and the introduction of a new aquatics program hosted at the local high school.",

While he always envisioned a career in law, he didn't initially expect to become a Family Law Lawyer. His passion for public service grew from a desire to keep Los Alamitos a thriving and desirable place to live. Before serving as Mayor and Councilmember, Mr. Nefulda contributed to his community as a member of the Los Alamitos Parks, Recreation, and Cultural Arts Commission and began his public service journey by joining the United States Army. As Mayor and Councilmember, Mr. Nefulda takes pride in supporting the growth and retention of the Los Alamitos Police Department. He emphasizes the Council's dedication to ensuring proper allocation of Measure Y sales tax funds, which supports essential services like public safety, parks, and infrastructure projects. Looking ahead, Mr. Nefulda aims to enhance community integration and expand services through partnerships with the Joint Forces Training Base. Mr. Nefulda's role as Mayor has allowed him to build strong connections with community members, city leaders, and the business sector. Yet, his greatest pride is his family. Despite the demands of his law practice and public duties, being a devoted Husband and Father is his first priority.",

She is the first representative for District 3 in the City's inaugural district elections. Her priorities focus on public safety, enhancing quality of life, fiscal responsibility, and driving economic development. Cynthia has demonstrated a strong commitment to public safety and traffic management. Her initiatives include advocating for intersection improvements throughout Mission Viejo, including the installation of a refuge lane on Marguerite Parkway at La Sierra Drive (2026). She also advocates for lower speed limits near schools, increasing crossing guards, adding marked crosswalks near parks and schools, and installing a protective fence around Napoli Park (2023).",

She has been actively involved with local organizations and has supported her children\u2019s education by volunteering in school parent organizations, scouting groups, and sports teams. Her work with the PTA sparked a deep passion for advocacy, leading her to travel to Sacramento to engage with lawmakers on issues such as student mental health and school funding. In January 2020, Keri authored a resolution at the California State PTA convention that called for enhanced mental health services for youth, including increasing the number of school counselors at every level. Her tireless volunteer efforts have earned her several accolades, including the Presidential Service Gold Award, the Fourth District PTA Advocacy Award, and the SVUSD Community Volunteer Recognition Award.

In 2008, Councilmember Penaloza worked as a part-time office clerk at Color Science, Inc., a local company specializing in compounding raw materials and resins to produce plastic. He was a key player in the ISO accreditation of the company, which allowed him to move up to his current position as Senior Regulatory Engineer. In 2018, Councilmember Penaloza was inspired by the students he was tutoring and the neglect he witnessed firsthand in Santa Ana. Penaloza had a strong desire to give back to the only place he has called home. For these reasons, he decided to run for Santa Ana City Council. Personally knocking on over 6,000 doors throughout Santa Ana, Councilmember Penaloza won 27 percent of the vote in a crowded field of six candidates, earning him a seat on the Santa Ana City Council to represent Ward 2.
