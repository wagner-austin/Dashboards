In doing so, Mayor Hupp seeks team-building to achieve mutually-beneficial goals. Mayor Hupp considers herself a fiscal conservative, who believes in prudent spending, as well as transparency in government. While in office, she has lobbied both the state and federal levels over issues such as paramedic tax reform, local control, and pension reform. Mayor Hupp exudes fiscal resourcefulness through having established a $10 million PARS irrevocable trust fund account to assist with the City’s employee retirement obligations. Additionally, she judiciously approved a 25% fiscal reserve policy for the City of Brea’s annual budget.",

        "bio": "Councilmember Mike Carroll is serving his second 4-year term on the Irvine City Council. Appointed in 2019 on a bi-partisan basis to fill a vacancy, in 2020 he was elected to a four-year term and then re-elected in 2024, where he received the highest number of votes in the City’s history. With over 318,000 residents, Irvine is the second largest city in Orange County, California, the sixth largest county in the United States. Irvine is a multi-award-winning master-planned community. It is the most diversely integrated city and has been the safest city in America for nearly 20 years in a row. Carroll is also Vice Chairman of the Great Park, the largest under-development municipal park in the nation. Spanning 1,300 acres and hosting 6 million annual visits, the Great Park’s 500 acres completed to date embrace recreation, competitive sports, parkland, and the environment. As a salute to our veterans, the Great Park honors the memory of the former Marine Corps Air Station El Toro. The Great Park is setting the gold standard for park design, and upon completion, it will be a national treasure among the great metropolitan parks of the world.",

        "bio": "William Go was elected to the Irvine City Council in 2024 as the first Councilmember to represent District 2 and the first Chinese Filipino American to serve on the Council. William is also Chairman of the Great Park, currently the nation’s largest municipal park under development. Covering 1,300 acres and welcoming approximately 6 million visitors each year, the 500 acres already completed feature a dynamic mix of recreational spaces, competitive sports facilities, preserved parkland, and environmental stewardship. In tribute to our veterans, the Great Park thoughtfully preserves and honors the legacy of the former Marine Corps Air Station El Toro. By establishing a new benchmark for innovative park design, the Great Park is poised to become a world-class metropolitan treasure upon full completion. William and his family immigrated to the United States when he was a child. Raised alongside his four siblings by their mother, William saw her work tirelessly to provide for their family, instilling in him the values of hard work and perseverance. Born in the Philippines to a mother of Chinese descent, he speaks three languages: English, Tagalog, and Chinese.",

Her journey began with an appointment to the Los Alamitos City Council in 2019, followed by a resounding election to her first full term in 2020, supported by her extensive community involvement and volunteerism. With a robust background in human resources and personnel development spanning over 20 years, Tanya has brought invaluable skills to her role. She is known for her engaging leadership style and commitment to policies that are equitable, efficient, and fiscally responsible. Under her stewardship, Los Alamitos has rebuilt its law enforcement team and strengthened its overall management structure, achieving a fully staffed and funded public safety operation for the first time in nearly a decade. Tanya Doby's dedication to partnerships extends to her role as a founding member of an interagency working group with the Los Alamitos School District. This collaborative effort focuses on enhancing educational opportunities and ensuring safe environments for local children. Notable joint ventures include initiatives to improve school safety and the introduction of a new aquatics program hosted at the local high school.",

His passion for public service grew from a desire to keep Los Alamitos a thriving and desirable place to live. Before serving as Mayor and Councilmember, Mr. Nefulda contributed to his community as a member of the Los Alamitos Parks, Recreation, and Cultural Arts Commission and began his public service journey by joining the United States Army. As Mayor and Councilmember, Mr. Nefulda takes pride in supporting the growth and retention of the Los Alamitos Police Department. He emphasizes the Council's dedication to ensuring proper allocation of Measure Y sales tax funds, which supports essential services like public safety, parks, and infrastructure projects. Looking ahead, Mr. Nefulda aims to enhance community integration and expand services through partnerships with the Joint Forces Training Base. Mr. Nefulda's role as Mayor has allowed him to build strong connections with community members, city leaders, and the business sector. Yet, his greatest pride is his family. Despite the demands of his law practice and public duties, being a devoted Husband and Father is his first priority.",

She has been actively involved with local organizations and has supported her children’s education by volunteering in school parent organizations, scouting groups, and sports teams. Her work with the PTA sparked a deep passion for advocacy, leading her to travel to Sacramento to engage with lawmakers on issues such as student mental health and school funding. In January 2020, Keri authored a resolution at the California State PTA convention that called for enhanced mental health services for youth, including increasing the number of school counselors at every level. Her tireless volunteer efforts have earned her several accolades, including the Presidential Service Gold Award, the Fourth District PTA Advocacy Award, and the SVUSD Community Volunteer Recognition Award.

After attending Santa Ana College, he was accepted to California State University, Los Angeles and graduated in 2011 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English. Councilmember Penaloza remains active in his community by supporting Santa Ana youth through his volunteer work at his local church. During his college career, Councilmember Penaloza overcame several obstacles, including paying tuition and supporting his mother financially. While in college, he took acting classes as a hobby, which eventually led him to be booked on numerous national commercials. His success qualified him membership into SAG-AFTRA, the most distinguished performers' union in the world. In 2008, Councilmember Penaloza worked as a part-time office clerk at Color Science, Inc., a local company specializing in compounding raw materials and resins to produce plastic. He was a key player in the ISO accreditation of the company, which allowed him to move up to his current position as Senior Regulatory Engineer. In 2018, Councilmember Penaloza was inspired by the students he was tutoring and the neglect he witnessed firsthand in Santa Ana. Penaloza had a strong desire to give back to the only place he has called home. For these reasons, he decided to run for Santa Ana City Council. Personally knocking on over 6,000 doors throughout Santa Ana, Councilmember Penaloza won 27 percent of the vote in a crowded field of six candidates, earning him a seat on the Santa Ana City Council to represent Ward 2. He was sworn in on December 11, 2018.",

She was born near a refugee camp in Thailand after her parents fled the devastation of the Vietnam War. They settled in Santa Ana in 1989 after months of living in camps in Thailand and the Philippines. Tragically, her father succumbed to brain cancer soon after arriving in the States. Councilmember Phan's mother worked as a babysitter watching neighborhood kids, and they lived in garages and make-shift bedrooms with other families to make ends meet. Like many first-generation immigrant families fleeing conflict and oppression, they were no strangers to poverty. Despite the struggle of growing up with few resources and reliant on the social safety net, Councilmember Phan excelled in the classroom. She attended local public schools—all in the Garden Grove Unified School District, including Morningside, Hazard, Heritage, Skylark, and Simmons Elementary Schools and was the first in her family to graduate high school (Los Amigos High School—2006). She completed her Bachelor of Arts in Communication Studies at the University of California Los Angeles and later graduated from the University of Southern California with a dual Law/Master of Public Policy degree.

Councilmember Hernandez grew up in Artesia Pilar amidst a challenging decade for the neighborhood in the 1990s. Born in the summer of '92, he lived houses away from El Salvador Park and was a witness to numerous tragedies.

As a result of his upbringing by the age of 14 Councilmember Hernandez began to organize political events with youth in his community.
