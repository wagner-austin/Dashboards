City Council Elections
Elections for City Council seats are held on the first Tuesday in November of even-numbered years, coinciding with state and national elections. Council Members are elected at-large for a four-year term and serve "staggered" terms, meaning that each election fills either two or three open seats. Beginning with the 2024 election, City Councilmembers will be elected by district. In 2024, District 1, District 3, and District 5 will be elected, and in 2026, District 2 and District 4 will be elected.

Selection of Mayor
The City’s Mayor and Mayor Pro Tem are selected at the first meeting of each December to serve a one-year term beginning January 1. These positions are filled by sitting Council Members by a vote of the majority of members.

Mayor Max Duncan
Elected: November 2022
Term Expires: November 2026
Represents: At-Large
Max Duncan was elected at to the Aliso Viejo City Council in 2022 for a four-year term and currently serves as Mayor Pro Tem for 2025. Max is the first representative of Aliso Viejo’s 2nd District. This district includes the neighborhoods near Canyon View Park, Westridge Park, Oak Park, Soka University and more. 

Max graduated from the University of Phoenix in 2004 with a Bachelor of Science in Business Information Systems. A self-proclaimed “techie” since he was a child, Max spent his youth taking apart electronics to see how they worked, and by the age of nine was writing code and running one of Orange County’s first online chat rooms. 

This passion led Max to a long and accomplished career in the technology field. In addition to starting multiple businesses, he has also worked as an engineer for various tech companies.   

Max spent his childhood in Brea and Fullerton, before settling down in Aliso Viejo with his family. He is heavily involved in the community, providing leadership for Adventure Guides through the YMCA and coaching and volunteering with the Aliso Viejo Little League (AVLL), the Aliso Viejo Girls Softball (AVGS), and the American Youth Soccer Organization (AYSO).  

In his free time, Max enjoys exploring nature with his wife and two children.

MAYOR & CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS

Citizens elect a five member City Council on a nonpartisan basis for staggered four-year terms. Municipal elections are held on the first Tuesday in November on even numbered years. Because Council terms overlap, three positions are open at one election and two positions are open at the next election two years later. Members elected to serve on the Council must be registered voters and City residents.

Annually, the City Council elects one of its members to serve as Mayor and another to serve as Vice Mayor. The Mayor is the Presiding Officer at City Council meetings. Additionally, he or she makes committee assignments and represents the City at official functions. The Vice Mayor assumes the duties of the Mayor in his or her absence.

The City Council Members are elected officers identified in Government Code Section 87200 and file statements of economic interests with the City Clerk's office. Copies of the statements of economic interests filed by the above elected officers may be obtained by visiting the offices of the Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC) or the City Clerk. The physical address of the FPPC is 428 J Street, Suite 620, Sacramento, California 95814. The physical address of the City Clerk's office is 6650 Beach Boulevard, Buena Park, California 90621. The statements of economic interests for some state and local government agency elected officers may be available in electronic format on the FPPC's website at http://www.fppc.ca.gov/Opens in new window.
