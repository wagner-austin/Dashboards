    bio: Mayor Amezcua is the first female Mayor in the City of Santa Ana's 153-year history. Mayor Amezcua has served 
      as a member of the Santa Ana Unified School District (SAUSD) Governing Board since 2014. She has served as the 
      Board's President or Vice President for five of the past eight years. Over the course of her two terms on the 
      School Board, she has implemented common sense reforms to improve graduation rates, increase campus safety and 
      expand parent involvement. She is a strong advocate for community health access, and played a key role in the 
      expansion of mental health services throughout SAUSD. She also led the effort to get additional training for SAUSD
      Police Officers to improve relationships with students and community members, implementing a positive 
      community-based approach to campus safety. Mayor Amezcua is a mentor, a bridge builder, and a collaborator who 
      understands the value of partnerships to the long-term success of our neighborhoods and community-at-large. Having
      achieved progress in her efforts on behalf of Santa Ana's youth, Mayor Amezcua brings her leadership, vision, and 
      passion for public service to the work of city government. She is committed to creating a more prosperous and 
      sustainable future for Orange County's second most populated city.

    bio: Councilmember David Penaloza, born and raised in Santa Ana, is a lifetime resident of the city. A product of 
      the Santa Ana Unified School District, he attended Washington Elementary (1999), MacArthur Fundamental (2002), and
      Saddleback High School (2006). After attending Santa Ana College, he was accepted to California State University, 
      Los Angeles and graduated in 2011 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English. Councilmember Penaloza remains active
      in his community by supporting Santa Ana youth through his volunteer work at his local church. During his college 
      career, Councilmember Penaloza overcame several obstacles, including paying tuition and supporting his mother 
      financially. While in college, he took acting classes as a hobby, which eventually led him to be booked on 
      numerous national commercials. His success qualified him membership into SAG-AFTRA, the most distinguished 
      performers' union in the world. In 2008, Councilmember Penaloza worked as a part-time office clerk at Color 
      Science, Inc., a local company specializing in compounding raw materials and resins to produce plastic. He was a 
      key player in the ISO accreditation of the company, which allowed him to move up to his current position as Senior
      Regulatory Engineer. In 2018, Councilmember Penaloza was inspired by the students he was tutoring and the neglect 
      he witnessed firsthand in Santa Ana. Penaloza had a strong desire to give back to the only place he has called 
      home. For these reasons, he decided to run for Santa Ana City Council. Personally knocking on over 6,000 doors 
      throughout Santa Ana, Councilmember Penaloza won 27 percent of the vote in a crowded field of six candidates, 
      earning him a seat on the Santa Ana City Council to represent Ward 2. He was sworn in on December 11, 2018.

    bio: Councilmember Thai Viet Phan is proud to be the first Vietnamese American and first Asian woman to serve as a 
      Santa Ana Councilmember. She was born near a refugee camp in Thailand after her parents fled the devastation of 
      the Vietnam War. They settled in Santa Ana in 1989 after months of living in camps in Thailand and the 
      Philippines. Tragically, her father succumbed to brain cancer soon after arriving in the States. Councilmember 
      Phan's mother worked as a babysitter watching neighborhood kids, and they lived in garages and make-shift bedrooms
      with other families to make ends meet. Like many first-generation immigrant families fleeing conflict and 
      oppression, they were no strangers to poverty. Despite the struggle of growing up with few resources and reliant 
      on the social safety net, Councilmember Phan excelled in the classroom. She attended local public schools—all in 
      the Garden Grove Unified School District, including Morningside, Hazard, Heritage, Skylark, and Simmons Elementary
      Schools and was the first in her family to graduate high school (Los Amigos High School—2006). She completed her 
      Bachelor of Arts in Communication Studies at the University of California Los Angeles and later graduated from the
      University of Southern California with a dual Law/Master of Public Policy degree. Throughout college and graduate 
      school, Councilmember Phan worked multiple part-time jobs to supplement her student loans and afford housing and 
      tuition, including serving burgers as an In-N-Out Burger Associate for six years. Today, Thai works as a City 
      Attorney and provides legal advice and counsel to cities and other public agencies throughout Southern California.
      She previously served as a member of the Santa Ana Planning Commission, where she advised the City Council and 
      helped oversee an array of critical issues, including housing, land use, and small business development. Thai 
      currently serves on the Board of Directors of both the Vietnamese American Bar Association of Southern California 
      and the Heritage Museum of Orange County. She also serves on the Leadership, Equity, Advocacy, & Diversity 
      Advisory Board for the Rancho Santiago Community College District.

    bio: Councilmember Vazquez is a teacher at Valley High School, a cultural worker at El Centro Cultural de Mexico, 
      and a proud homeowner in the Heninger Park neighborhood. Councilmember Vazquez is fully invested in his community 
      and in the future of Santa Ana. He was born to working class immigrant parents and was raised on Center Street. 
      Councilmember Vazquez attended Santa Ana Unified School District schools, Santa Ana College, earned a Bachelor's 
      degree at Cal State Long Beach, and a Master's degree from UCLA. Councilmember Vazquez is now proudly working 
      alongside four siblings and two nieces at Santa Ana Unified School District. Giving back to Santa Ana youth and 
      community is not just his passion—it is a shared family goal. As a member of the City Council, Councilmember 
      Vazquez's focus will be on making sure our limited citywide resources benefit working class families and improve 
      quality of life for all Santa Ana residents. Our City budgets, policies, and resources need to be centered on 
      nurturing the families and communities of our city, instead of special interest groups. Councilmember Vazquez 
      believes that our City's plan and budgets need to reflect a vision that prioritizes working class families.

      sexual assault on campus and supported efforts in making higher education more accessible for individuals such as 
      herself. She continued her advocacy alongside community groups in her hometown to fight for equity, accountability
      and transparency. Jessie now works as a community health worker where she works towards improving the quality of 
      life and health of low-income, uninsured, under-served people, regardless of status, in her community. In March 
      2020, Jessie was elected by the working families of the 68th Assembly District to help represent their concerns as
      a central committee member within the Democratic Party of Orange County. Jessie is honored to represent Ward 3 and
      to serve the community that raised her. She is a firm believer in civic engagement, the right to equal treatment 
      and opportunity, and is passionate about empowering community participation. Jessie is an advocate for all Santa 
      Ana families, and with a demonstrated record of community leadership, she will provide effective representation 
      for Santa Ana. Jessie Lopez is an advocate and organizer at heart.

    bio: Councilmember Johnathan Ryan Hernandez was born and raised in Santa Ana and is a lifetime resident of the 
      Artesia Pilar neighborhood. He is proud of his family's deep roots in Santa Ana and is honored to raise his 
      daughter in the very community his family has called home for five generations and counting. Councilmember 
      Hernandez is a product of Santa Ana Unified School District (SAUSD) education system and attended Fremont 
      Elementary, Spurgeon Intermediate, and Santa Ana High School. He was raised by the combined effort of a 
      hard-working single mother and his grandparents. Councilmember Hernandez's grandfather, Enrique was a member of 
      the Laborers International Union, Local 652 and was an upstanding member for over 43 years. His grandparents, 
      Enrique and Indelisa, migrated to Santa Ana from Guadalajara, Mexico in the late 1950s. Councilmember Hernandez 
      grew up in Artesia Pilar amidst a challenging decade for the neighborhood in the 1990s. Born in the summer of '92,
      he lived houses away from El Salvador Park and was a witness to numerous tragedies. Like many multi-generational 
      Chicano families, he saw his family members and friends fall through the cracks and end up in the prison system. 
      As a result of his upbringing by the age of 14 Councilmember Hernandez began to organize political events with 
      youth in his community. By the time he was 23, he began working with youth in the community, offering boxing, 
      music, and art programs to at-promise youth. In 2015, Councilmember Hernandez was part of The Mixed Martial Arts 
      Association (MMAFA), a collective of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) athletes that worked to introduce legislation that 
      would extend protections from the sport of boxing to the sport of MMA. In May 2015, a bill was introduced to 
      Congress by Markwayne Mullin, a politician and former mixed martial artist, to extend the Ali Act to MMA.
