  bio: Councilmember Vazquez is a teacher at Valley High School, a cultural worker at El Centro Cultural de México, and a

    future of Santa Ana. He was born to working class immigrant parents and was raised on Center Street. Councilmember Vazquez

    and a Master’s degree from UCLA. Councilmember Vazquez is now proudly working alongside four siblings and two nieces at
    Santa Ana Unified School District. Giving back to Santa Ana youth and community is not just his passion—it is a shared
    family goal. As a member of the City Council, Councilmember Vazquez’s focus will be on making sure our limited citywide
    resources benefit working class families and improve quality of life for all Santa Ana residents. Our City budgets, policies,
    and resources need to be centered on nurturing the families and communities of our city, instead of special interest groups.
    Councilmember Vazquez believes that our City’s plan and budgets need to reflect a vision that prioritizes working class
    families.

  bio: Councilmember David Penaloza, born and raised in Santa Ana, is a lifetime resident of the city. A product of the Santa
    Ana Unified School District, he attended Washington Elementary (1999), MacArthur Fundamental (2002), and Saddleback High
    School (2006). After attending Santa Ana College, he was accepted to California State University, Los Angeles and graduated
    in 2011 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English. Councilmember Penaloza remains active in his community by supporting
    Santa Ana youth through his volunteer work at his local church. During his college career, Councilmember Penaloza overcame
    several obstacles, including paying tuition and supporting his mother financially. While in college, he took acting classes
    as a hobby, which eventually led him to be booked on numerous national commercials. His success qualified him membership
    into SAG-AFTRA, the most distinguished performers’ union in the world. In 2008, Councilmember Penaloza worked as a part-time
    office clerk at Color Science, Inc., a local company specializing in compounding raw materials and resins to produce plastic.
    He was a key player in the ISO accreditation of the company, which allowed him to move up to his current position as Senior
    Regulatory Engineer. In 2018, Councilmember Penaloza was inspired by the students he was tutoring and the neglect he witnessed
    firsthand in Santa Ana. Penaloza had a strong desire to give back to the only place he has called home. For these reasons,
    he decided to run for Santa Ana City Council. Personally knocking on over 6,000 doors throughout Santa Ana, Councilmember
    Penaloza won 27 percent of the vote in a crowded field of six candidates, earning him a seat on the Santa Ana City Council
    to represent Ward 2. He was sworn in on December 11, 2018.

  bio: Councilmember Johnathan Ryan Hernandez was born and raised in Santa Ana and is a lifetime resident of the Artesia Pilar
    neighborhood. He is proud of his family’s deep roots in Santa Ana and is honored to raise his daughter in the very community
    his family has called home for five generations and counting. Councilmember Hernandez is a product of Santa Ana Unified
    School District (SAUSD) education system and attended Fremont Elementary, Spurgeon Intermediate, and Santa Ana High School.
    He was raised by the combined effort of a hard-working single mother and his grandparents. Councilmember Hernandez’s grandfather,
    Enrique was a member of the Laborers International Union, Local 652 and was an upstanding member for over 43 years. His
    grandparents, Enrique and Indelisa, migrated to Santa Ana from Guadalajara, Mexico in the late 1950s. Councilmember Hernandez
    grew up in Artesia Pilar amidst a challenging decade for the neighborhood in the 1990s. Born in the summer of ‘92, he
    lived houses away from El Salvador Park and was a witness to numerous tragedies. Like many multi-generational Chicano
    families, he saw his family members and friends fall through the cracks and end up in the prison system. As a result of
    his upbringing by the age of 14 Councilmember Hernandez began to organize political events with youth in his community.
    By the time he was 23, he began working with youth in the community, offering boxing, music, and art programs to at-promise
    youth. In 2015, Councilmember Hernandez was part of The Mixed Martial Arts Association (MMAFA), a collective of Mixed
    Martial Arts (MMA) athletes that worked to introduce legislation that would extend protections from the sport of boxing
    to the sport of MMA. In May 2015, a bill was introduced to Congress by Markwayne Mullin, a politician and former mixed
    martial artist, to extend the Ali Act to MMA.

  city_page: https://www.santa-ana.org/contacts/thai-viet-phan/
  bio: Councilmember Thai Viet Phan is proud to be the first Vietnamese American and first Asian woman to serve as a Santa
    Ana Councilmember. She was born near a refugee camp in Thailand after her parents fled the devastation of the Vietnam
    War. They settled in Santa Ana in 1989 after months of living in camps in Thailand and the Philippines. Tragically, her
    father succumbed to brain cancer soon after arriving in the States. Councilmember Phan’s mother worked as a babysitter
    watching neighborhood kids, and they lived in garages and make-shift bedrooms with other families to make ends meet. Like
    many first-generation immigrant families fleeing conflict and oppression, they were no strangers to poverty. Despite the
    struggle of growing up with few resources and reliant on the social safety net, Councilmember Phan excelled in the classroom.
    She attended local public schools—all in the Garden Grove Unified School District, including Morningside, Hazard, Heritage,
    Skylark, and Simmons Elementary Schools and was the first in her family to graduate high school (Los Amigos High School—2006).
    She completed her Bachelor of Arts in Communication Studies at the University of California Los Angeles and later graduated
    from the University of Southern California with a dual Law/Master of Public Policy degree. Throughout college and graduate
    school, Councilmember Phan worked multiple part-time jobs to supplement her student loans and afford housing and tuition,
    including serving burgers as an In-N-Out Burger Associate for six years. Today, Thai works as a City Attorney and provides
    legal advice and counsel to cities and other public agencies throughout Southern California. She previously served as
    a member of the Santa Ana Planning Commission, where she advised the City Council and helped oversee an array of critical
    issues, including housing, land use, and small business development. Thai currently serves on the Board of Directors of
    both the Vietnamese American Bar Association of Southern California and the Heritage Museum of Orange County. She also
    serves on the Leadership, Equity, Advocacy, & Diversity Advisory Board for the Rancho Santiago Community College District.
