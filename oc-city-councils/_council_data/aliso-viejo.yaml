  bio: Garrett Dwyer was appointed in 2025 to represent the 3rd District of the Aliso Viejo City Council. This district includes
    our Town Center and The Commons, Grand Park, Woodfield Park, and communities surrounded by Alicia Parkway, Pacific Park
    Drive and State Route 73. Garrett and his wife moved to Aliso Viejo in 2004 to build their family and quickly became enamored
    with the city. From the quality of the schools and parks to the safety of the streets, Garrett knew this was his place
    to plant roots. As his family has grown with kids and dogs and cats, so has Garrett's service to our community. There's
    a good chance you've seen him serving as either a PTA treasurer, soccer coach, AYSO board member, substitute instructor
    at church, HOA board member, or YMCA Adventure Guides Expedition Navigator.
