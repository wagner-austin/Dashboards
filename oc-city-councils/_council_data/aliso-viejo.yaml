  bio: Garrett Dwyer was appointed in 2025 to represent the 3rd District of the Aliso Viejo City Council. This district
    includes our Town Center and The Commons, Grand Park, Woodfield Park, and communities surrounded by Alicia Parkway,
    Pacific Park Drive and State Route 73. Garrett and his wife moved to Aliso Viejo in 2004 to build their family and
    quickly became enamored with the city. From the quality of the schools and parks to the safety of the streets,
    Garrett knew this was his place to plant roots. As his family has grown with kids and dogs and cats, so has
    Garrett's service to our community. There's a good chance you've seen him serving as either a PTA treasurer, soccer
    coach, AYSO board member, substitute instructor at church, HOA board member, or YMCA Adventure Guides Expedition
    Navigator.
