    bio: Keri has been a resident of Rancho Santa Margarita since 2002 and has dedicated herself to serving the 
      community through various volunteer roles. She has been actively involved with local organizations and has 
      supported her children’s education by volunteering in school parent organizations, scouting groups, and sports 
      teams. Her work with the PTA sparked a deep passion for advocacy, leading her to travel to Sacramento to engage 
      with lawmakers on issues such as student mental health and school funding. In January 2020, Keri authored a 
      resolution at the California State PTA convention that called for enhanced mental health services for youth, 
      including increasing the number of school counselors at every level. Her tireless volunteer efforts have earned 
      her several accolades, including the Presidential Service Gold Award, the Fourth District PTA Advocacy Award, and 
      the SVUSD Community Volunteer Recognition Award. Trabuco Hills PTSA - President, EVP, VP of Advocacy Rancho Santa
