  bio: Keri has been a resident of Rancho Santa Margarita since 2002 and has dedicated herself to serving the community through
    various volunteer roles. She has been actively involved with local organizations and has supported her children’s education
    by volunteering in school parent organizations, scouting groups, and sports teams. Her work with the PTA sparked a deep
    passion for advocacy, leading her to travel to Sacramento to engage with lawmakers on issues such as student mental health
    and school funding. In January 2020, Keri authored a resolution at the California State PTA convention that called for
    enhanced mental health services for youth, including increasing the number of school counselors at every level. Her tireless
    volunteer efforts have earned her several accolades, including the Presidential Service Gold Award, the Fourth District
    PTA Advocacy Award, and the SVUSD Community Volunteer Recognition Award. Trabuco Hills PTSA - President, EVP, VP of Advocacy
