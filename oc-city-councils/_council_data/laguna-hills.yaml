  bio: Councilwoman Erica Pezold and her husband, Eric Pezold, an attorney at Snell & Wilmer LLP, and their three children
    have been residents of Laguna Hills for over ten years. Erica served as an HOA board of directors and volunteered for
    organizations such as the Constitutional Rights Foundation, LNYSA, Working Wardrobes, and others. Erica turned down an
    opportunity to enter into a doctoral program in psychology and decided to focus on her family, her small business, and
    her community. Erica wasted no time improving the City; she started by creating council member offices and co-authored
    Laguna Hills' campaign finance law. Erica organized Laguna Hills' first business meeting connecting the City and the businesses
    and added City announcements to the agenda. Erica demonstrated ingenuity by adding video messaging to the City, including
    quarterly reports from the Sheriff's Services, and designating a prescription drop-off site at the Civic Center. As a
    strong community supporter, Erica co-created with the Laguna Hills Chamber of Commerce their annual Holiday Light Extravaganza;
    she also structured a partnership with the Chamber of Commerce that included office space at the Civic Center. She filled
    the Community Center with activities during the winter holiday months and brought Movies in the Park to city residents.
    In addition, Erica felt it essential to revitalize the LH on the hillside and championed the idea to the Council.

  bio: As the Mayor of Laguna Hills, I am honored to serve the city I love and call home. Laguna Hills is not just where I
    live—it’s where I’ve built my life, my family, and my future. I am committed to making sure that every resident feels
    valued and that our city continues to thrive as a safe, vibrant, and inclusive community. Even though Laguna Hills is
    not a large city, I strongly believe we can and should have a powerful presence. Far too often, smaller cities are overshadowed
    by larger ones and overlooked in Sacramento and Washington, D.C. I am determined to ensure that Laguna Hills’ voice is
    heard, advocating for our community’s needs and fighting for the city I hold so dear to my heart. My philosophy as a public
    servant is rooted in the belief that leadership is about service. I believe in the principles of servant leadership—listening
    first, putting others’ needs before my own, and acting with humility and integrity. Public officials should never forget
    that they are here to serve the people, and I strive to embody that responsibility in every decision I make.
