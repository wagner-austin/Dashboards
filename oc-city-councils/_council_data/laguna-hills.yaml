    bio: Councilwoman Erica Pezold and her husband, Eric Pezold, an attorney at Snell & Wilmer LLP, and their three 
      children have been residents of Laguna Hills for over ten years. Erica served as an HOA board of directors and 
      volunteered for organizations such as the Constitutional Rights Foundation, LNYSA, Working Wardrobes, and others. 
      Erica turned down an opportunity to enter into a doctoral program in psychology and decided to focus on her 
      family, her small business, and her community. Erica wasted no time improving the City; she started by creating 
      council member offices and co-authored Laguna Hills' campaign finance law. Erica organized Laguna Hills' first 
      business meeting connecting the City and the businesses and added City announcements to the agenda. Erica 
      demonstrated ingenuity by adding video messaging to the City, including quarterly reports from the Sheriff's 
      Services, and designating a prescription drop-off site at the Civic Center. As a strong community supporter, Erica
      co-created with the Laguna Hills Chamber of Commerce their annual Holiday Light Extravaganza; she also structured 
      a partnership with the Chamber of Commerce that included office space at the Civic Center. She filled the 
      Community Center with activities during the winter holiday months and brought Movies in the Park to city 
      residents. In addition, Erica felt it essential to revitalize the LH on the hillside and championed the idea to 
      the Council.

    bio: As the Mayor of Laguna Hills, I am honored to serve the city I love and call home. Laguna Hills is not just 
      where I live—it’s where I’ve built my life, my family, and my future. I am committed to making sure that every 
      resident feels valued and that our city continues to thrive as a safe, vibrant, and inclusive community. Even 
      though Laguna Hills is not a large city, I strongly believe we can and should have a powerful presence. Far too 
      often, smaller cities are overshadowed by larger ones and overlooked in Sacramento and Washington, D.C. I am 
      determined to ensure that Laguna Hills’ voice is heard, advocating for our community’s needs and fighting for the 
      city I hold so dear to my heart. My philosophy as a public servant is rooted in the belief that leadership is 
      about service. I believe in the principles of servant leadership—listening first, putting others’ needs before my 
      own, and acting with humility and integrity. Public officials should never forget that they are here to serve the 
      people, and I strive to embody that responsibility in every decision I make.
