    bio: Tanya Doby has distinguished herself as a leader in Los Alamitos, earning recognition as a 2023 Woman of 
      Distinction by both the State Senate and Assembly and Woman of the Year for her assembly district in 2024. Her 
      journey began with an appointment to the Los Alamitos City Council in 2019, followed by a resounding election to 
      her first full term in 2020, supported by her extensive community involvement and volunteerism. With a robust 
      background in human resources and personnel development spanning over 20 years, Tanya has brought invaluable 
      skills to her role. She is known for her engaging leadership style and commitment to policies that are equitable, 
      efficient, and fiscally responsible. Under her stewardship, Los Alamitos has rebuilt its law enforcement team and 
      strengthened its overall management structure, achieving a fully staffed and funded public safety operation for 
      the first time in nearly a decade. Tanya Doby's dedication to partnerships extends to her role as a founding 
      member of an interagency working group with the Los Alamitos School District. This collaborative effort focuses on
      enhancing educational opportunities and ensuring safe environments for local children. Notable joint ventures 
      include initiatives to improve school safety and the introduction of a new aquatics program hosted at the local 
      high school.

    bio: Mr. Nefulda earned his Bachelor's in Business Administration from California State University, Long Beach, and 
      his Juris Doctorate from Chapman University Fowler School of Law. While he always envisioned a career in law, he 
      didn't initially expect to become a Family Law Lawyer. His passion for public service grew from a desire to keep 
      Los Alamitos a thriving and desirable place to live. Before serving as Mayor and Councilmember, Mr. Nefulda 
      contributed to his community as a member of the Los Alamitos Parks, Recreation, and Cultural Arts Commission and 
      began his public service journey by joining the United States Army. As Mayor and Councilmember, Mr. Nefulda takes 
      pride in supporting the growth and retention of the Los Alamitos Police Department. He emphasizes the Council's 
      dedication to ensuring proper allocation of Measure Y sales tax funds, which supports essential services like 
      public safety, parks, and infrastructure projects. Looking ahead, Mr. Nefulda aims to enhance community 
      integration and expand services through partnerships with the Joint Forces Training Base. Mr. Nefulda's role as 
      Mayor has allowed him to build strong connections with community members, city leaders, and the business sector. 
      Yet, his greatest pride is his family. Despite the demands of his law practice and public duties, being a devoted 
      Husband and Father is his first priority.
