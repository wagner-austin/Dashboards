  bio: Mr. Nefulda earned his Bachelor’s in Business Administration from California State University, Long Beach, and his
    Juris Doctorate from Chapman University Fowler School of Law. While he always envisioned a career in law, he didn’t initially
    expect to become a Family Law Lawyer. His passion for public service grew from a desire to keep Los Alamitos a thriving
    and desirable place to live. Before serving as Mayor and Councilmember, Mr. Nefulda contributed to his community as a
    member of the Los Alamitos Parks, Recreation, and Cultural Arts Commission and began his public service journey by joining
    the United States Army. As Mayor and Councilmember, Mr. Nefulda takes pride in supporting the growth and retention of
    the Los Alamitos Police Department. He emphasizes the Council’s dedication to ensuring proper allocation of Measure Y
    sales tax funds, which supports essential services like public safety, parks, and infrastructure projects. Looking ahead,
    Mr. Nefulda aims to enhance community integration and expand services through partnerships with the Joint Forces Training
    Base. Mr. Nefulda’s role as Mayor has allowed him to build strong connections with community members, city leaders, and
    the business sector. Yet, his greatest pride is his family. Despite the demands of his law practice and public duties,
    being a devoted Husband and Father is his first priority.
