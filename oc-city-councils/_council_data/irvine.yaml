    bio: Councilmember Mike Carroll is serving his second 4-year term on the Irvine City Council. Appointed in 2019 on a
      bi-partisan basis to fill a vacancy, in 2020 he was elected to a four-year term and then re-elected in 2024, where
      he received the highest number of votes in the City’s history. With over 318,000 residents, Irvine is the second 
      largest city in Orange County, California, the sixth largest county in the United States. Irvine is a 
      multi-award-winning master-planned community. It is the most diversely integrated city and has been the safest 
      city in America for nearly 20 years in a row. Carroll is also Vice Chairman of the Great Park, the largest 
      under-development municipal park in the nation. Spanning 1,300 acres and hosting 6 million annual visits, the 
      Great Park’s 500 acres completed to date embrace recreation, competitive sports, parkland, and the environment. As
      a salute to our veterans, the Great Park honors the memory of the former Marine Corps Air Station El Toro. The 
      Great Park is setting the gold standard for park design, and upon completion, it will be a national treasure among
      the great metropolitan parks of the world.

    bio: 'William Go was elected to the Irvine City Council in 2024 as the first Councilmember to represent District 2 and
      the first Chinese Filipino American to serve on the Council. William is also Chairman of the Great Park, currently the
      nation’s largest municipal park under development. Covering 1,300 acres and welcoming approximately 6 million visitors
      each year, the 500 acres already completed feature a dynamic mix of recreational spaces, competitive sports facilities,
      preserved parkland, and environmental stewardship. In tribute to our veterans, the Great Park thoughtfully preserves
      and honors the legacy of the former Marine Corps Air Station El Toro. By establishing a new benchmark for innovative
      park design, the Great Park is poised to become a world-class metropolitan treasure upon full completion. William and
      his family immigrated to the United States when he was a child. Raised alongside his four siblings by their mother,
      William saw her work tirelessly to provide for their family, instilling in him the values of hard work and perseverance.
