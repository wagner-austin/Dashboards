  bio: Kim was born in Allentown, Pennsylvania.  After living for a while in Lebanon and Australia, her family moved to California.
     She’s lived in Fountain Valley for many years and is a member of several local organizations. One of her most proud moments
    was in 2011 at the Fountain Valley Chamber of Commerce Board Installation Luncheon, when she was named Ambassador-of-the
    Year.  Within minutes, she was the first person in the Chamber’s 45-year history to be nominated from the floor.  When
    the votes were tallied from that day’s election, she was elected to the Board.  It meant so much that the members had
    faith in her.  Kim served four years as a Director.  At that time, she knew she wanted to serve her community as a City
    Council Member and began laying the groundwork for her first campaign in 2014.  She ran again in 2016 and remained persistent
    and highly visible. Kim enjoys staying abreast of City matters, cooking, and traveling… to Europe, especially.
