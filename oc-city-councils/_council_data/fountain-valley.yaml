    bio: Kim was born in Allentown, Pennsylvania.  After living for a while in Lebanon and Australia, her family moved 
      to California.  She’s lived in Fountain Valley for many years and is a member of several local organizations. One 
      of her most proud moments was in 2011 at the Fountain Valley Chamber of Commerce Board Installation Luncheon, when
      she was named Ambassador-of-the Year.  Within minutes, she was the first person in the Chamber’s 45-year history 
      to be nominated from the floor.  When the votes were tallied from that day’s election, she was elected to the 
      Board.  It meant so much that the members had faith in her.  Kim served four years as a Director.  At that time, 
      she knew she wanted to serve her community as a City Council Member and began laying the groundwork for her first 
      campaign in 2014.  She ran again in 2016 and remained persistent and highly visible. Kim enjoys staying abreast of
      City matters, cooking, and traveling… to Europe, especially.
