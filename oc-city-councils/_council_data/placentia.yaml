    photo_url: https://www.placentia.org/ImageRepository/Document?documentID=14591
    bio: Councilmember Thomas Hummer moved to Placentia with his family in 1971. He attended PYLUSD schools Brookhaven 
      Elementary, Tuffree Jr. High, and El Dorado High School. His experience as a child and adolescent in Placentia was
      instrumental in shaping who he is today. From having great neighborhood and community friends to very 
      inspirational teachers and coaches throughout all three schools, all have played a part in his positive upbringing
      here. As a young adult, he moved away from Placentia for a while, but this town has always been considered his 
      home. My parents still live here, and he has always felt lucky to have grown up here. He moved back to Placentia 
      in 2020 to be close to his aging parents. Professionally, he has been an educator since 2005. He has taught Jr. 
      High and High School, where he also coached Football and Soccer, and most recently, he has worked for Five Keys 
      Charter School, where he works with at-risk minors and adults to earn their High School Diploma or GED.

      raise their family here so they could enjoy the same experiences he had growing up. Living in Placentia is a
      privilege that he does not take lightly. Professionally, Kevin owns and operates a company that specializes in
