  bio: Councilmember Thomas Hummer moved to Placentia with his family in 1971. He attended PYLUSD schools Brookhaven Elementary,
    Tuffree Jr. High, and El Dorado High School. His experience as a child and adolescent in Placentia was instrumental in
    shaping who he is today. From having great neighborhood and community friends to very inspirational teachers and coaches
    throughout all three schools, all have played a part in his positive upbringing here. As a young adult, he moved away
    from Placentia for a while, but this town has always been considered his home. My parents still live here, and he has
    always felt lucky to have grown up here. He moved back to Placentia in 2020 to be close to his aging parents. Professionally,
    he has been an educator since 2005. He has taught Jr. High and High School, where he also coached Football and Soccer,
    and most recently, he has worked for Five Keys Charter School, where he works with at-risk minors and adults to earn their
    High School Diploma or GED.
