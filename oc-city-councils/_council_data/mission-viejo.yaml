    bio: Mayor Wendy Bucknum was initially elected to serve as a member of the Mission Viejo City Council in 2014. She 
      brings a wealth of practical business experience, a long history of community involvement, and a solid record of 
      volunteerism in our schools, community, and youth sports programs. Mayor Bucknum has a strong business background 
      from her 30+ years serving in the community association and development industry and is a champion for City 
      policies that are fair, understandable, cost effective, and good for the economy. She is a mom who values 
      partnerships with schools to give Mission Viejo youth a meaningful educational experience and safe place to learn.
      As an active volunteer she understands the unique needs of kids, families, and seniors, and supports programs to 
      serve all. Wendy's primary goals are to maintain and enhance Mission Viejo's public safety record, create a 
      healthy local business economy, streamline governmental processes, preserve parks, trails and open spaces, to 
      protect Mission Viejo's schools and neighborhoods, and to maintain and enhance city infrastructure and the 
      community facilities Mission Viejo residents use and enjoy.
