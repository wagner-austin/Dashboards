    of life in Mission Viejo.  She advanced the expansion of the Norman P. Murray Community and Senior Center, the renovations

    continues to promote the regular renovations of our City parks, to provide updated equipment and enhancements for the
    enjoyment of our residents.  She also supported the City's purchase of Oso Creek Golf Course to preserve over 100 acres
    of open space and to save and improve a beloved asset in Mission Viejo. In 2003, Trish led the City Council to establish
    Mission Viejo as a City of Character.   She helped to develop a city-wide character program, which focuses on a different
    character quality each month.  She wrote the curriculum, which is provided to the City's 25 schools, various City facilities,
    and featured on the City website.  The program has received awards at the state and national levels.   Trish has been
    a presenter at state and national conferences, teaching other organizations how to bring similar character programs to
    their communities.
