    a wealth of practical business experience, a long history of community involvement, and a solid record of volunteerism

    kids, families, and seniors, and supports programs to serve all. Wendy's primary goals are to maintain and enhance Mission
    Viejo's public safety record, create a healthy local business economy, streamline governmental processes, preserve parks,
    trails and open spaces, to protect Mission Viejo's schools and neighborhoods, and to maintain and enhance city infrastructure
    and the community facilities Mission Viejo residents use and enjoy.
