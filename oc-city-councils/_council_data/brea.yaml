    bio: Mayor Cecilia Hupp was elected to the Brea City Council in November 2014, and re-elected in 2018 and 2022. She 
      previously served as Mayor in 2017, during Brea’s Centennial Year, and in 2022. During her service on the City 
      Council, Mayor Hupp has championed housing and community development and advocates for affordable housing 
      opportunities for senior citizens. Mayor Hupp has surveyed the progress of innovative, mixed-use developments at 
      La Floresta, Brea Place, and Central Park Village. She has presided over the conversion of repurposed railroad 
      tracks into a 50-acre linear, multi-use trail, known as the Tracks at Brea, as well as the construction of the 57 
      Freeway/Lambert Road Interchange. Mayor Hupp has also overseen the implementation of two regional homeless 
      Navigation Centers, in partnership with North Orange County Cities, and approved Brea’s first workforce-housing 
      project. In doing so, Mayor Hupp seeks team-building to achieve mutually-beneficial goals. Mayor Hupp considers 
      herself a fiscal conservative, who believes in prudent spending, as well as transparency in government. While in 
      office, she has lobbied both the state and federal levels over issues such as paramedic tax reform, local control,
      and pension reform. Mayor Hupp exudes fiscal resourcefulness through having established a $10 million PARS 
      irrevocable trust fund account to assist with the City’s employee retirement obligations. Additionally, she 
      judiciously approved a 25% fiscal reserve policy for the City of Brea’s annual budget.
