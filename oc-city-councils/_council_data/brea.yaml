  bio: Mayor Cecilia Hupp was elected to the Brea City Council in November 2014, and re-elected in 2018 and 2022. She previously
    served as Mayor in 2017, during Brea’s Centennial Year, and in 2022. During her service on the City Council, Mayor Hupp
    has championed housing and community development and advocates for affordable housing opportunities for senior citizens.
    Mayor Hupp has surveyed the progress of innovative, mixed-use developments at La Floresta, Brea Place, and Central Park
    Village. She has presided over the conversion of repurposed railroad tracks into a 50-acre linear, multi-use trail, known
    as the Tracks at Brea, as well as the construction of the 57 Freeway/Lambert Road Interchange. Mayor Hupp has also overseen
    the implementation of two regional homeless Navigation Centers, in partnership with North Orange County Cities, and approved
    Brea’s first workforce-housing project. In doing so, Mayor Hupp seeks team-building to achieve mutually-beneficial goals.
    Mayor Hupp considers herself a fiscal conservative, who believes in prudent spending, as well as transparency in government.
    While in office, she has lobbied both the state and federal levels over issues such as paramedic tax reform, local control,
    and pension reform. Mayor Hupp exudes fiscal resourcefulness through having established a $10 million PARS irrevocable
    trust fund account to assist with the City’s employee retirement obligations. Additionally, she judiciously approved a
    25% fiscal reserve policy for the City of Brea’s annual budget.
