Sheriffs

Sheriffs wear more hats than you think

County sheriffs in Kentucky have a saying: No sheriff stands alone.

That’s a statement that drives all the efforts of our 120 county sheriffs and their offices when it comes to protecting the public at large.

However, sheriffs have many more responsibilities including:

patrol
investigations
court room security
prisoner transports
serving court papers and eviction notices
vehicle inspections
tax and fee collection
